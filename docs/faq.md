### <h3 id="InstallFAQ">Installation FAQs </h3>
<b class="blue"> Q1.</b> I have setup my own gateway and Airavata. When I log into the gateway I cannot create Compute resources. What should I do?</br>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> In your pga_config.php (in folder .../testdrive/app/config) under heading 'Portal Related Configurations' set 'super-admin-portal' => false, to true.</br>
<br><b class="blue">Q2.</b> I don't get notifications when users create new accounts in my gateway. Why?</br>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> That's because you have not defined an email address in <br>'admin-emails' => ['xxx@xxx.com','yyy@yyy.com']. Here you can add one or many.</br>
<br><br><b class="blue"> Q3.</b>  I am not receiving email notifications from compute resources for job status changes. What should I do?</br>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> In airavata-server.properties please locate and set your email account information.
<pre><code>email.based.monitor.host=imap.gmail.com
email.based.monitor.address=airavata-user@kuytje.nl
email.based.monitor.password=zzzz
email.based.monitor.folder.name=INBOX
email.based.monitor.store.protocol=imaps (either imaps or pop3)</pre></code>
<br><br><b class="blue"> Q4.</b>  In my Airavata log I have error messages like
<br>ERROR org.apache.airavata.api.server.handler.AiravataServerHandler  - Error occurred while retrieving SSH public keys for gateway
<br>ERROR org.apache.airavata.credential.store.server.CredentialStoreServerHandler  - Error occurred while retrieving credentials
<br></br>What should I do?<br>
<br><b class="blue">Answer: </b> This could be due to missing tables in your credential store database. Check whether CREDENTIALS and COMMUNITY_USER tables exits. If not create then using
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE COMMUNITY_USER
(
        GATEWAY_ID VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
        COMMUNITY_USER_NAME VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
        TOKEN_ID VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
        COMMUNITY_USER_EMAIL VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (GATEWAY_ID, COMMUNITY_USER_NAME, TOKEN_ID)
);
</pre></code>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE CREDENTIALS
(
        GATEWAY_ID VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
        TOKEN_ID VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
        CREDENTIAL BLOB NOT NULL,
        PORTAL_USER_ID VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
        TIME_PERSISTED TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ON UPDATE NOW(),
        PRIMARY KEY (GATEWAY_ID, TOKEN_ID)
);
</pre></code>
<br><br><b class="blue"> Q5.</b>  I cannot login to my Compute Resource and launch jobs from Airavata using the SSH key I generated. What should I do?
<br><b class="blue">Answer: </b> Steps to use generated SSH key<br>

### <h3 id="userFAQ"> User FAQs </h3>
<b class="blue"> Q1 </b> What is the Project? </br>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> </br>
    - Project is simply a collection of experiments. </br>
    - When creating an experiment it will be under the project you select.</br>
    - Projects can be shared with fellow gateway users. </br>
    - When the project is shared all experiments in the project will be shared as well.

<br><b class="blue"> Q2 </b> Where can I get test inputs? <br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> If you need test inputs try downloading from <a href="https://iu.box.com/s/9ztdby709kso8siachz16svn2y511nn7" target="_blank">Test Input Files</a> <br/>

<br><b class="blue"> Q3 </b> Do I need to provide values for wall-time, node count and CPU count? OR can I go ahead with the given default values? <br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> Default values are given to make life little easy for users. But depending on the job you should change the values. </br>E.g.: If you need only two or less cores than 16 better to change. If you need more wall-time change it, etc....<br/>
	
	
<br><b class="blue"> Q4 </b> What can I do with email Notifications in experiment? <br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> Submitting a job from PGA does not guarantee job getting executed in the remote resource right away. If you add your email address, when the job starts and completes an email will be sent to you from the remote resource.<br/>

<br><b class="blue"> Q5 </b> Why 'Save' and 'Save and Launch'? <br>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> User has the option of either create and 'Save' the experiment for later launch at remote resource <br/>Or <br/>
		can directly 'Save and Launch' at once.<br/>

<br><b class="blue"> Q6 </b> How do I monitor progress?<br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> When the experiment is launched navigate to Experiment Summary Page.
		There the experiment and job status will be present.
		You can monitor the experiment and job status changes. Refresh the status using 'Refresh' icon on top  of the summary page.<br/>

<br><b class="blue"> Q7 </b> How do I view/download my outputs? <br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> Same way you monitor the experiment progress! 
		<br/>For each experiment inputs can be downloaded from<br/>
		- Experiment Summary page<br/>
		- From 'Storage' at the top menu. Here you need to know the Project the experiment belongs to. 
		<br/> Once you locate the project you can browse for your experiment. <br/>

<br><b class="blue"> Q8 </b> I want to bring back all the outputs generated by my job. How?<br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> You need to request your gateway admin to simply set Archive to 'true' in respective application interface in Admin Dashboard. Then all the files in the working directory will be brought back to PGA. This flag is set at gateway level not at individual user level.

<br><b class="blue"> Q9 </b> I want to cancel my experiment. How?<br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> Navigate to experiment Summary and click 'Cancel' button.
	Experiments only in operation (LAUNCHED, EXECUTING experiment statuses) can be cancelled.

<br><b class="blue"> Q10 </b> 2. When I cancel do I still receive any outputs generated?<br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> Files will be not transferred from the remote resource if the experiment is cancelled. However, if the output files were transferred to PGA data directories prior to the cancel request then they will be displayed.

<br><b class="blue"> Q11 </b> How can I run same application with different different inputs?<br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> Simply clone an existing experiment and change the input files and launch.

<br><b class="blue"> Q12 </b> I want to change the wall-time of my experiment before launch. How can I do?<br/>
<b class="blue">Answer: </b> Experiments in CREATED state can be modified through Experiment Summary page. Click 'Edit' change values and Save or Save and Launch.
