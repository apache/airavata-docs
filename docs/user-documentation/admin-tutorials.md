## Admin Dashboard Configurations

This page is dedicated to Gateway Admins!

### Prior to starting your configurations
1. You have admin access to the PGA portal, Admin Dashboard
    - How to check?
        - Log in to the gateway portal
        - You would land on Admin Dashboard with "Let's Get Started!"
        - Click 'Browse Application Modules'
        - Do you see button 'Create new Application Interface' ? Then you are good.
2. Storage resource ID is added to the pga_config.php </br>
    - If not go to  
        - Admin Dashboard &rarr; Storage Resources &rarr; Browse
        - Locate your resource and copy the ID
        - Paste it in pga_config.php file in pga/app/config directory.
3. Credentials generated, assigned and added to authorized_keys files of resources
    - To generate key refer [Credential Store](../configuration/pga-configuration.md#credential-store)
    - Token Assignment [Gateway Management](../configuration/pga-configuration.md#gateway-management-of-resources)
    - Copy the public key for the assigned token frm credential store and add it to authorized_keys file in both compute and storage resources.

NOTE: If you are using a hosted gateway the 2 and 4 would be taken cared by the SciGaP team.

##### <h5 id="Resources">Register your Compute & Storage Resources</h5><br>
###### <b><u>Register Local Resource </u></b>
<b class="lred"> NOTE:</b> Only Super gateway admins can add compute resources and storage resources. <br> Gateway need to be hsoted locally and have access to Compute Resources &rarr; Register <br>
<br><b>What is a compute resource? </b><br>A compute resource is an object that represents a host, host cluster, or pool in a virtualization platform, a virtual data center, or an Amazon region on which machines can be provisioned. 
<br>Compute resource could come as national resources, campus resources or even private cluster. 
<br>NOTE:For testing purposes users (mainly gateway developers) this could even be the local machine.

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard &rarr; Compute Resource &rarr; Register <br>
2. Provide
    - Host Name: Local Resource<br>
    - Host Aliases: <br>
    - IP Addresses:<br>
    - Resource Description: My local resource for application execution ( Just a description)<br>

3. In Queues tab<br> (A queue is not required ideally, but as per the gateway logic, queue is required)
    - Click 'Add a Queue'<br>
    - Queue Name: Normal ( Per resource this is a unique value. Once created cannot edit the name. If need to change, delete and create again)<br>
    - Queue Description: Local resource normal for job submission<br>

3. Create the application deployment: NEK5000 on BigRed2 (BigRed2 is the IU cluster. Using just as an example)
    - Navigate to Admin Dashboard &rarr; App Catalog &rarr; Application Deployment
    - Click 'Create new Application Deployment'
        - Application Module: Gaussian
        - Application Compute Host: bigred2.uits.iu.edu (Your cluster specific gateway preferences need to be added in 'Gateway Management' prior to this)
        - Application Executable Path: ./nek5000
        - Application Parallelism Type: CRAY_MPI
        - Application Deployment Description: Gaussian provides capabilities for electronic structure modeling.
        - Module Load Commands: module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu; module load nek5000 visit ffmpeg
        - Pre Job Commands: 
            - echo "nek5kbasename" > genmap.in;  echo "0.2" >> genmap.in;
            - echo nek5kbasename  > ./SESSION.NAME; echo 'pwd'/' >>  ./SESSION.NAME;
        - Post Job Commands: 
            - mkdir -p "$PWD"_restart; cp *.chk ${pwd}_restart; mv *.rwf* ${pwd}_restart; (Why? - any command you would want to execute after post job execution)</br>
